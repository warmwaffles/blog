## Free Time Activities

I enjoy playing with LibGDX and other various game platforms to gain knowledge
while having fun doing it.

I also toy with Elixir projects in my spare time.

I like working with my hands and building things in my garage. Any where from
cutting boards, welding, tearing motors apart, or just soldering electronics I
really enjoy doing.
