Well I transitioned out from my previous job working for Enfocus Solutions to
working for [ZippyKid][zippykid]. I love my new job and I am super excited to
work with a cool team of developers.

I haven't worked with PHP in over a year and it's interesting coming back to it
from working with Ruby and Java for a while. PHP makes me angry but also makes
me happy. After playing with PHP again I started to love some of the old
features like `die`, `vardump`, and `print_r`.

The newer features in PHP 5.3 has me excited. Namespaces are spiffy and allows
me to modularize my application even further. I also see it as being one step
closer to packages being swapped in and out easier. Ruby has gems, which I think
PHP is missing.
