So I have been learning a lot about Software Engineering in my Graduate class at
UTSA. I recently finished reading "The Mythical Man Month" by Fred Brooks. It was
an interesting read and I think it holds very good points. But this post is not
about disecting that book. Rather this post is about a talk that I came across
and was very happy to see that Brooks principles were applied and re-adapted for
use in a modern era.

Enjoy!
