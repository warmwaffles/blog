Finally! I have graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio with a
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I waited for 4.5 years (9 semesters) to
finally reach this point in my life. Though now I wonder what awaits me in the
future.

Now I'm able to work Full Time at [ZippyKid][zippykid] where I help build and
maintain the deployment system. Ever since I started working here in January
2012, I've grown a lot and I have learned a TON.

Things I've learned:

  * Rails is not the answer to all questions
  * Venturing out of your comfort zone is great
  * Good OO design is not easy
  * There is no silver bullet
  * No one really knows what they are doing in software engineering
